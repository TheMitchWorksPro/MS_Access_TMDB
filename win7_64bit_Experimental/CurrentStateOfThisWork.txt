Current State
--------------------------------

Switchboard Menus:
* modified to support 23 buttons in two columns
* Main dashboard illustrates this usage

Excel_Macros code (excel_macros/TM_DB_Reports_FormattingTemplate.xlsm):
* working file from 2012 has password locked VB Project
* 2010 (vb project) was not locked and is in use in this project
* subfolder now has excel files from 2010, 2011, and 2012 to help w/ future research
  ** only the 2010 one is unlocked (VB Project)
* the current working file and Access have been debugged for this implementation (Office 2013 on 64bit Win7)
* this implementation uses the new .xlsm format for the macros and reporting

Help files re-organized and moved to github project
- edit them there



-----------------------------------------------------------------
Future planning:  Not done - thoughts about making this better
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Create an alternate reporting dashboard with all source reports as query windows
  ** user can then copy and paste into Excel should reporting macros have issues after a Microsoft software upgrade
  ** this can serve as a hedge against tendency for MS Office VB to break with each new software release

* restructure existing dashboards for new 2-column code
  ** only main dashboard takes advantage of this feature right now
  ** could make all buttons available in fewer dashboards using the dashboard TableEditor

* create Demo and Main file copies from current working file
* create .accde files to demonstrate roll-out
  ** see help topics for hiding all currently exposed developer features

* note:  demo_converter folder - incomplete code started years ago and never finished
  ** this code could be explored and completed

* chage report writing path so reports go ito reporting subfolder and not root of db

* come up with way to automate steps to prep a db before building a .accde file
